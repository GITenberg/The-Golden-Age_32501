description: A collection of reminiscences of childhood. The adventures of five brothers
  and sisters growing up in rural England in the late nineteenth century. Typical
  of his culture and his era, Grahame casts his reminiscences in imagery and metaphor
  rooted in the culture of Ancient Greece; to the children whose impressions are recorded
  in the book, the adults in their lives are "Olympians," while the chapter titled
  "The Argonauts" refers to Perseus, Apollo, Psyche, and similar figures of Greek
  mythology. Grahame's reminiscences, in The Golden Age and in the later Dream Days
  (1898), were notable for their conception "of a world where children are locked
  in perpetual warfare with the adult 'Olympians' who have wholly forgotten how it
  feels to be young".
